While working on an Expo project, I encountered an unusual issue where the app crashed intermittently with no clear error message in the console.  The crash only occurred on Android devices and seemed to be related to a specific network request.  The request itself was not throwing any errors, but the app would unexpectedly terminate shortly after the request completed. This made debugging very difficult because there were no explicit errors to track down. The crash was inconsistent, not reproducible every time the request was made.
