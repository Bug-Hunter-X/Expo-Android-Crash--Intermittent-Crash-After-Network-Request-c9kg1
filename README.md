# Expo Android Crash: Intermittent Crash After Network Request

This repository demonstrates an intermittent crash issue experienced on Android devices within an Expo application. The crash occurs after a seemingly successful network request, without providing any clear error messages in the console logs.  This makes debugging challenging due to the lack of explicit error information and inconsistent reproducibility.

## Problem Description

The application utilizes a network request to fetch data from an API.  While the request generally completes successfully, the application will crash unexpectedly on some Android devices shortly after.  No specific errors are logged, making the root cause difficult to isolate.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the network request process. This includes catching potential exceptions during the request itself, as well as monitoring for post-request conditions that might indicate a problem.  Additionally, adding more detailed logs and considering the use of a crash reporting service can provide valuable insights into the intermittent crashes.
